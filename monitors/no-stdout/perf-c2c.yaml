Description:
  Perf C2C monitor is aimed for capturing hot cache line miss during the
  process of running workload, the total number of local/remote cache line
  HITM would be a very important performance metric to evaluate our
  optimzation work. Also, the top 3 cache lines ranked by HITM number
  should be given serious care as main optimization target.

  The first version of code refers to monitor/no-stdout/perf-profile.

Usage:

Parameters:
  event: "[ldlat-loads|ldlat-stores] :: PMU event :: All as default"

  ldlat: "[30|50|*] :: Configure mem-load latency :: 30 as default"
  delay: "[15|20|*] :: Delay *N* seconds before sampling :: 100 as default, or half of runtime if runtime is set"
  duration: "[10|20|*] :: Record sample within *N* seconds :: 10 as default"
