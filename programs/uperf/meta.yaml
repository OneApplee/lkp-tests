  uperf is a network performance tool that supports modelling and replay of various networking patterns.

description: |
  uperf represents a new kind of benchmarking tool (like filebench) where instead of
  running a fixed benchmark or workload, a description (or model) of the workload is
  provided and the tool generates the load according to the model. By distilling the
  benchmark or workload into a model, you can now do various things like change the
  scale of the workload, change different parameters, change protocols, etc and
  analyse the effect of these changes on your model. You can also study the effect
  of interleaving CPU activity, or think times or the use of SSL instead of TCP
  among many other things.
